In particular, it critically explores new forms of empiricism that declare ‘the end of theory’, the creation of data-driven rather than knowledge-driven science, and the development of digital humanities and computational social sciences that propose radically different ways to make sense of culture, history, economy and society. It is argued that: (1) Big Data and new data analytics are disruptive innovations which are reconfiguring in many instances how research is conducted; and (2) there is an urgent need for wider critical reflection within the academy on the epistemological implications of the unfolding data revolution, a task that has barely begun to be tackled despite the rapid changes in research practices presently taking place. After critically reviewing emerging epistemological positions, it is contended that a potentially fruitful approach would be the development of a situated, reflexive and contextually nuanced epistemology. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.', 'link': 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073682542&doi=10.1177%2f2053951714528481&partnerID=40&md5=49cbcd64a939cb47af2f8996d0c114a2', 'citations': 1062, 'keywords': ['Big Data', 'computational social sciences', 'data analytics', 'data-driven science', 'digital humanities', 'end of theory', 'epistemology', 'paradigms'], 'authors': ['Kitchin R.']}, {'doi': '10.1007/s11192-014-1229-3', 'title': 'Disciplinary differences in Twitter scholarly communication', 'abstract': 'This paper investigates disciplinary differences in how researchers use the microblogging site Twitter.

Biochemists retweeted substantially more than researchers in the other disciplines. Researchers in digital humanities and cognitive science used Twitter more for conversations, while researchers in economics shared the most links.

This paper aims to investigate the use of Twitter by an academic community in various conference settings, and to pose the following questions: Does the use of a Twitter\\ue4f8enabled backchannel enhance the conference experience, collaboration and the co\\ue4f8construction of knowledge? and How is microblogging used within academic conferences, and can one articulate the benefits it may bring to a discipline? Design/methodology/approach This paper considers the use of Twitter as a digital backchannel by the Digital Humanities (DH) community, taking as its focus postings to Twitter during three different international 2009 conferences. The resulting archive of 4,574 “Tweets” was analysed using various quantitative and qualitative methods, including a qualitative categorisation of Twitter posts by open coded analysis, a quantitative examination of user conventions, and text analysis tools. Prominent Tweeters were identified and a small qualitative survey was undertaken to ascertain individuals' attitudes towards a Twitter\\ue4f8enabled backchannel. Findings – Conference hashtagged Twitter activity does not constitute a single distributed conversation, but rather multiple monologues with a few intermittent, discontinuous, loosely joined dialogues between users. The digital backchannel constitutes a multidirectional complex space in which the users make notes, share resources, hold discussions and ask questions as well as establishing a clear individual online presence. The use of Twitter as a conference platform enables the community to expand communication and participation in events amongst its members. The analysis revealed the close\\ue4f8knit nature of the DH researcher community, which may be somewhat intimidating for those new to the field or conference. Practical implications This study has indicated that, given that Twitter is becoming increasingly important for academic communities, new, dedicated methodologies for the analysis and understanding of Tweet\\ue4f8based corpora are necessary. Routinely used textual analysis tools cannot be applied to corpora of Tweets in a straightforward manner, due to the creative and fragmentary nature of language used within microblogging. In this paper, a method has been suggested to categorise Tweets using open coded analysis to facilitate understanding of Tweet\\ue4f8based corpora, which could be adopted elsewhere. Originality/value – This paper is the first known exhaustive study that concentrates on how microblogging technologies such as Twitter are used by and can benefit scholars. This data set both provides a valuable insight into the prevalence of a variety of Twitter practices within the constraints of a conference setting, and highlights the need for methodologies to be developed to analyse social media streams such as Twitter feeds. It also provides a bibliography of other research into microblogging. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited\", 'link': 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79952292203&doi=10.1108%2f00220411111109449&partnerID=40&md5=63335e5ffd7293ab3b3c3a465d083c7a', 'citations': 144, 'keywords': ['Conferences', 'Digital communication systems', 'Social networks', 'User studies'], 'authors': ['Ross C.', 'Terras M.', 'Warwick C.', 'Welsh A.']}, {'doi': '10.1108/AJIM-09-2013-0094', 'title': 'Programmed method: Developing a toolset for capturing and analyzing tweets', 'abstract': 'Purpose–The purpose of this paper is to introduce Digital Methods Initiative Twitter Capture and Analysis Toolset, a toolset for capturing and analyzing Twitter data. Instead of just presenting a technical paper detailing the system, however, the authors argue that the type of data used for, as well as the methods encoded in, computational systems have epistemological repercussions for research. The authors thus aim at situating the development of the toolset in relation to methodological debates in the social sciences and humanities. Design/methodology/approach–The authors review the possibilities and limitations of existing approaches to capture and analyze Twitter data in order to address the various ways in which computational systems frame research. The authors then introduce the open-source toolset and put forward an approach that embraces methodological diversity and epistemological plurality. Findings–The authors find that design decisions and more general methodological reasoning can and should go hand in hand when building tools for computational social science or digital humanities. Practical implications–Besides methodological transparency, the software provides robust and reproducible data capture and analysis, and interlinks with existing analytical software. Epistemic plurality is emphasized by taking into account how Twitter structures information, by allowing for a number of different sampling techniques, by enabling a variety of analytical approaches or paradigms, and by facilitating work at the micro, meso, and macro levels. Originality/value–The paper opens up critical debate by connecting tool design to fundamental interrogations of methodology and its repercussions for the production of knowledge. The design of the software is inspired by exchanges and debates with scholars from a variety of disciplines and the attempt to propose a flexible and extensible tool that accommodates a wide array of methodological approaches is directly motivated by the desire to keep computational work open for various epistemic sensibilities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.', 'link': 'https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928249663&doi=10.1108%2fAJIM-09-2013-0094&partnerID=40&md5=503326daa805093e265cece8d666ac3d', 'citations': 143, 'keywords': ['Analysis', 'Computational social science', 'Data collection', 'Digital humanities', 'Digital methods', 'Twitter'], 'authors': ['Borra E.', 'Rieder B.']}, {'doi': '10.32614/rj-2016-007', 'title': 'Stylometry with R: A package for computational text analysis', 'abstract': \"This software paper describes 'Stylometry with R' (stylo), a flexible R package for the highlevel analysis of writing style in stylometry.

In this paper we introduce the possibilities of stylo for computational text analysis, via a number of dummy case studies from English and French literature. We demonstrate how the package is particularly useful in the exploratory statistical analysis of texts, e.g. with respect to authorial writing style. Because stylo provides an attractive graphical user interface for high-level exploratory analyses, it is especially suited for an audience of novices, without programming skills (e.g. from the Digital Humanities).

There is a growing recognition of the need, however, to test whether GIS can be used to map out the qualitative 'data' provided by the articulation of subjective spatial experiences. This paper expands the conceptual possibilities opened up by the use of GIS technology through an exploration of the theoretical potentiality of literary GIS. Drawing on work carried out as part of an interdisciplinary project, 'Mapping the Lakes', the paper focuses on the ways in which GIS can be used to explore the spatial relationships between two textual accounts of tours of the English Lake District: the proto-Picturesque journey undertaken by the poet, Thomas Gray, in the autumn of 1769; and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's self-consciously post-Picturesque 'circumcursion' of August 1802. Alongside this text-specific focus, the paper also draws on recent spatial literary criticism to reflect, more generally, on the critical possibilities and problems associated with the digital mapping of space and place in literature.

After critically reviewing emerging epistemological positions, it is contended that a potentially fruitful approach would be the development of a situated, reflexive and contextually nuanced epistemology. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.', 'num_chars': 1318, 'num_words': 216, 'unique_words': 135, 'points': {'interrogation': 0, 'exclamation': 0}, 'word_analysis': {'#noun': 53, '#adjective': 20, '#adverb': 8, '#verb': 24, 'lexical_diversity': 105, 'lexical_density': 48.61111111111111}, 'sentiment_analysis': 'Error in sentiment analysis'}, 'summarized_abstract': {'summarized_text': 'This article examines how the availability of Big Data, coupled with new data analytics, challenges established epistemologies across the sciences, social sciences and humanities, and assesses the extent to which they are engendering paradigm shifts across multiple disciplines.', 'num_chars': 278, 'num_words': 43, 'unique_words': 35, 'points': {'interrogation': 0, 'exclamation': 0}, 'word_analysis': {'#noun': 13, '#adjective': 3, '#adverb': 0, '#verb': 5, 'lexical_diversity': 21, 'lexical_density': 48.837209302325576}, 'sentiment_analysis': [{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.7975685000419617}]}, 'author_keywords': [{'keyword': 'Big Data', 'python_dictionary': 'No meaning found', 'wikipedia': 'Big data refers to data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software.', 'context_from_abstract': 'This article examines how the availability of Big Data, coupled with new data analytics, challenges established epistemologies across the sciences, social sciences and humanities, and assesses the extent to which they are engendering paradigm shifts across multiple disciplines.'}, {'keyword': 'computational social sciences', 'python_dictionary': 'No meaning found', 'wikipedia': 'Computational social science is the academic sub-discipline concerned with computational approaches to the social sciences.', 'context_from_abstract': 'In particular, it critically explores new forms of empiricism that declare ‘the end of theory’, the creation of data-driven rather than knowledge-driven science, and the development of digital humanities and computational social sciences that propose radically different ways to make sense of culture, history, economy and society.'}, {'keyword': 'data analytics', 'python_dictionary': 'No meaning found', 'wikipedia': 'Data analysis  is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.', 'context_from_abstract': 'This article examines how the availability of Big Data, coupled with new data analytics, challenges established epistemologies across the sciences, social sciences and humanities, and assesses the extent to which they are engendering paradigm shifts across multiple disciplines.'}, {'keyword': 'data-driven science', 'python_dictionary': 'No meaning found', 'wikipedia': 'Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data, and apply knowledge from data across a broad range of application domains.', 'context_from_abstract': 'No meaning found'}, {'keyword': 'digital humanities', 'python_dictionary': 'No meaning found', 'wikipedia': 'Digital humanities (DH) is an area of scholarly activity at the intersection of computing or digital technologies and the disciplines of the humanities.', 'context_from_abstract': 'In particular, it critically explores new forms of empiricism that declare ‘the end of theory’, the creation of data-driven rather than knowledge-driven science, and the development of digital humanities and computational social sciences that propose radically different ways to make sense of culture, history, economy and society.'}, {'keyword': 'end of theory', 'python_dictionary': 'No meaning found', 'wikipedia': 'The Low End Theory is the second studio album by American hip-hop group A Tribe Called Quest, released on September 24, 1991, by Jive Records.', 'context_from_abstract': 'In particular, it critically explores new forms of empiricism that declare ‘the end of theory’, the creation of data-driven rather than knowledge-driven science, and the development of digital humanities and computational social sciences that propose radically different ways to make sense of culture, history, economy and society.'}, {'keyword': 'epistemology', 'python_dictionary': {'Noun': ['the philosophical theory of knowledge']}, 'wikipedia': \"Epistemology ( (listen);

This paper aims to investigate the use of Twitter by an academic community in various conference settings, and to pose the following questions: Does the use of a Twitter\\ue4f8enabled backchannel enhance the conference experience, collaboration and the co\\ue4f8construction of knowledge? and How is microblogging used within academic conferences, and can one articulate the benefits it may bring to a discipline? Design/methodology/approach This paper considers the use of Twitter as a digital backchannel by the Digital Humanities (DH) community, taking as its focus postings to Twitter during three different international 2009 conferences. The resulting archive of 4,574 “Tweets” was analysed using various quantitative and qualitative methods, including a qualitative categorisation of Twitter posts by open coded analysis, a quantitative examination of user conventions, and text analysis tools. Prominent Tweeters were identified and a small qualitative survey was undertaken to ascertain individuals' attitudes towards a Twitter\\ue4f8enabled backchannel. Findings – Conference hashtagged Twitter activity does not constitute a single distributed conversation, but rather multiple monologues with a few intermittent, discontinuous, loosely joined dialogues between users. The digital backchannel constitutes a multidirectional complex space in which the users make notes, share resources, hold discussions and ask questions as well as establishing a clear individual online presence. The use of Twitter as a conference platform enables the community to expand communication and participation in events amongst its members. The analysis revealed the close\\ue4f8knit nature of the DH researcher community, which may be somewhat intimidating for those new to the field or conference. Practical implications This study has indicated that, given that Twitter is becoming increasingly important for academic communities, new, dedicated methodologies for the analysis and understanding of Tweet\\ue4f8based corpora are necessary. Routinely used textual analysis tools cannot be applied to corpora of Tweets in a straightforward manner, due to the creative and fragmentary nature of language used within microblogging. In this paper, a method has been suggested to categorise Tweets using open coded analysis to facilitate understanding of Tweet\\ue4f8based corpora, which could be adopted elsewhere. Originality/value – This paper is the first known exhaustive study that concentrates on how microblogging technologies such as Twitter are used by and can benefit scholars. This data set both provides a valuable insight into the prevalence of a variety of Twitter practices within the constraints of a conference setting, and highlights the need for methodologies to be developed to analyse social media streams such as Twitter feeds. It also provides a bibliography of other research into microblogging. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited\", 'num_chars': 3049, 'num_words': 488, 'unique_words': 253, 'points': {'interrogation': 2, 'exclamation': 0}, 'word_analysis': {'#noun': 116, '#adjective': 46, '#adverb': 10, '#verb': 60, 'lexical_diversity': 232, 'lexical_density': 47.540983606557376}, 'sentiment_analysis': 'Error in sentiment analysis'}, 'summarized_abstract': {'summarized_text': 'This paper aims to investigate the use of Twitter by an academic community in various conference settings, and to pose the following questions: Does the use of a Twitterenabled backchannel enhance the conference experience, collaboration and the coconstruction of knowledge?

Instead of just presenting a technical paper detailing the system, however, the authors argue that the type of data used for, as well as the methods encoded in, computational systems have epistemological repercussions for research. The authors thus aim at situating the development of the toolset in relation to methodological debates in the social sciences and humanities. Design/methodology/approach–The authors review the possibilities and limitations of existing approaches to capture and analyze Twitter data in order to address the various ways in which computational systems frame research. The authors then introduce the open-source toolset and put forward an approach that embraces methodological diversity and epistemological plurality. Findings–The authors find that design decisions and more general methodological reasoning can and should go hand in hand when building tools for computational social science or digital humanities. Practical implications–Besides methodological transparency, the software provides robust and reproducible data capture and analysis, and interlinks with existing analytical software. Epistemic plurality is emphasized by taking into account how Twitter structures information, by allowing for a number of different sampling techniques, by enabling a variety of analytical approaches or paradigms, and by facilitating work at the micro, meso, and macro levels. Originality/value–The paper opens up critical debate by connecting tool design to fundamental interrogations of methodology and its repercussions for the production of knowledge. The design of the software is inspired by exchanges and debates with scholars from a variety of disciplines and the attempt to propose a flexible and extensible tool that accommodates a wide array of methodological approaches is directly motivated by the desire to keep computational work open for various epistemic sensibilities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.', 'num_chars': 2115, 'num_words': 338, 'unique_words': 176, 'points': {'interrogation': 0, 'exclamation': 0}, 'word_analysis': {'#noun': 97, '#adjective': 36, '#adverb': 8, '#verb': 35, 'lexical_diversity': 176, 'lexical_density': 52.071005917159766}, 'sentiment_analysis': 'Error in sentiment analysis'}, 'summarized_abstract': {'summarized_text': 'Design/methodology/approach–The authors review the possibilities and limitations of existing approaches to capture and analyze Twitter data in order to address the various ways in which computational systems frame research.', 'num_chars': 223, 'num_words': 36, 'unique_words': 31, 'points': {'interrogation': 0, 'exclamation': 0}, 'word_analysis': {'#noun': 13, '#adjective': 2, '#adverb': 0, '#verb': 5, 'lexical_diversity': 20, 'lexical_density': 55.55555555555556}, 'sentiment_analysis': [{'label': 'NEU', 'score': 0.9519765377044678}]}, 'author_keywords': [{'keyword': 'Analysis', 'python_dictionary': {'Noun': ['an investigation of the component parts of a whole and their relations in making up the whole', 'the abstract separation of a whole into its constituent parts in order to study the parts and their relations', 'a form of literary criticism in which the structure of a piece of writing is analyzed', \"the use of closed-class words instead of inflections: e.g., `the father of the bride' instead of `the bride's father'\", 'a branch of mathematics involving calculus and the theory of limits;

There is a growing recognition of the need, however, to test whether GIS can be used to map out the qualitative 'data' provided by the articulation of subjective spatial experiences. This paper expands the conceptual possibilities opened up by the use of GIS technology through an exploration of the theoretical potentiality of literary GIS. Drawing on work carried out as part of an interdisciplinary project, 'Mapping the Lakes', the paper focuses on the ways in which GIS can be used to explore the spatial relationships between two textual accounts of tours of the English Lake District: the proto-Picturesque journey undertaken by the poet, Thomas Gray, in the autumn of 1769; and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's self-consciously post-Picturesque 'circumcursion' of August 1802. Alongside this text-specific focus, the paper also draws on recent spatial literary criticism to reflect, more generally, on the critical possibilities and problems associated with the digital mapping of space and place in literature. Ultimately, the paper seeks to open up methodological and critical space for the ongoing development of literary GIS. © 2010 The Authors.

After critically reviewing emerging epistemological positions, it is contended that a potentially fruitful approach would be the development of a situated, reflexive and contextually nuanced epistemology. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.', 'num_chars': 1318, 'num_words': 216, 'unique_words': 135, 'points': {'interrogation': 0, 'exclamation': 0}, 'word_analysis': {'#noun': 53, '#adjective': 20, '#adverb': 8, '#verb': 24, 'lexical_diversity': 105, 'lexical_density': 48.61111111111111}, 'sentiment_analysis': [{'label': 'LABEL_1', 'score': 0.7071953415870667}]}, 'summarized_abstract': {'summarized_text': 'The availability of Big Data and new data analytics challenges established epistemologies across the sciences, social sciences and humanities .

This paper aims to investigate the use of Twitter by an academic community in various conference settings, and to pose the following questions: Does the use of a Twitter\\ue4f8enabled backchannel enhance the conference experience, collaboration and the co\\ue4f8construction of knowledge? and How is microblogging used within academic conferences, and can one articulate the benefits it may bring to a discipline? Design/methodology/approach This paper considers the use of Twitter as a digital backchannel by the Digital Humanities (DH) community, taking as its focus postings to Twitter during three different international 2009 conferences. The resulting archive of 4,574 “Tweets” was analysed using various quantitative and qualitative methods, including a qualitative categorisation of Twitter posts by open coded analysis, a quantitative examination of user conventions, and text analysis tools. Prominent Tweeters were identified and a small qualitative survey was undertaken to ascertain individuals' attitudes towards a Twitter\\ue4f8enabled backchannel. Findings – Conference hashtagged Twitter activity does not constitute a single distributed conversation, but rather multiple monologues with a few intermittent, discontinuous, loosely joined dialogues between users. The digital backchannel constitutes a multidirectional complex space in which the users make notes, share resources, hold discussions and ask questions as well as establishing a clear individual online presence. The use of Twitter as a conference platform enables the community to expand communication and participation in events amongst its members. The analysis revealed the close\\ue4f8knit nature of the DH researcher community, which may be somewhat intimidating for those new to the field or conference. Practical implications This study has indicated that, given that Twitter is becoming increasingly important for academic communities, new, dedicated methodologies for the analysis and understanding of Tweet\\ue4f8based corpora are necessary. Routinely used textual analysis tools cannot be applied to corpora of Tweets in a straightforward manner, due to the creative and fragmentary nature of language used within microblogging. In this paper, a method has been suggested to categorise Tweets using open coded analysis to facilitate understanding of Tweet\\ue4f8based corpora, which could be adopted elsewhere. Originality/value – This paper is the first known exhaustive study that concentrates on how microblogging technologies such as Twitter are used by and can benefit scholars. This data set both provides a valuable insight into the prevalence of a variety of Twitter practices within the constraints of a conference setting, and highlights the need for methodologies to be developed to analyse social media streams such as Twitter feeds. It also provides a bibliography of other research into microblogging. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited\", 'num_chars': 3049, 'num_words': 488, 'unique_words': 253, 'points': {'interrogation': 2, 'exclamation': 0}, 'word_analysis': {'#noun': 116, '#adjective': 46, '#adverb': 10, '#verb': 60, 'lexical_diversity': 232, 'lexical_density': 47.540983606557376}, 'sentiment_analysis': 'Error in sentiment analysis'}, 'summarized_abstract': {'summarized_text': \"This paper aims to investigate the use of Twitter by an academic community in various conference settings .

Instead of just presenting a technical paper detailing the system, however, the authors argue that the type of data used for, as well as the methods encoded in, computational systems have epistemological repercussions for research. The authors thus aim at situating the development of the toolset in relation to methodological debates in the social sciences and humanities. Design/methodology/approach–The authors review the possibilities and limitations of existing approaches to capture and analyze Twitter data in order to address the various ways in which computational systems frame research. The authors then introduce the open-source toolset and put forward an approach that embraces methodological diversity and epistemological plurality. Findings–The authors find that design decisions and more general methodological reasoning can and should go hand in hand when building tools for computational social science or digital humanities. Practical implications–Besides methodological transparency, the software provides robust and reproducible data capture and analysis, and interlinks with existing analytical software. Epistemic plurality is emphasized by taking into account how Twitter structures information, by allowing for a number of different sampling techniques, by enabling a variety of analytical approaches or paradigms, and by facilitating work at the micro, meso, and macro levels. Originality/value–The paper opens up critical debate by connecting tool design to fundamental interrogations of methodology and its repercussions for the production of knowledge. The design of the software is inspired by exchanges and debates with scholars from a variety of disciplines and the attempt to propose a flexible and extensible tool that accommodates a wide array of methodological approaches is directly motivated by the desire to keep computational work open for various epistemic sensibilities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.', 'num_chars': 2115, 'num_words': 338, 'unique_words': 176, 'points': {'interrogation': 0, 'exclamation': 0}, 'word_analysis': {'#noun': 97, '#adjective': 36, '#adverb': 8, '#verb': 35, 'lexical_diversity': 176, 'lexical_density': 52.071005917159766}, 'sentiment_analysis': [{'label': 'LABEL_1', 'score': 0.9621460437774658}]}, 'summarized_abstract': {'summarized_text': 'The purpose of this paper is to introduce Digital Methods Initiative Twitter Capture and Analysis Toolset, a toolset for capturing and analyzing Twitter data .

Drawing on work carried out as part of an interdisciplinary project, 'Mapping the Lakes', the paper focuses on the ways in which GIS can be used to explore the spatial relationships between two textual accounts of tours of the English Lake District: the proto-Picturesque journey undertaken by the poet, Thomas Gray, in the autumn of 1769; and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's self-consciously post-Picturesque 'circumcursion' of August 1802. Alongside this text-specific focus, the paper also draws on recent spatial literary criticism to reflect, more generally, on the critical possibilities and problems associated with the digital mapping of space and place in literature. Ultimately, the paper seeks to open up methodological and critical space for the ongoing development of literary GIS. © 2010 The Authors.

Tweets from selected researchers in ten disciplines (astrophysics, biochemistry, digital humanities, economics, history of science, cheminformatics, cognitive science, drug discovery, social network analysis, and sociology) were collected and analyzed both statistically and qualitatively. The researchers tended to share more links and retweet more than the average Twitter users in earlier research and there were clear disciplinary differences in how they used Twitter. Biochemists retweeted substantially more than researchers in the other disciplines. Researchers in digital humanities and cognitive science used Twitter more for conversations, while researchers in economics shared the most links. Finally, whilst researchers in biochemistry, astrophysics, cheminformatics and digital humanities seemed to use Twitter for scholarly communication, scientific use of Twitter in economics, sociology

This paper aims to investigate the use of Twitter by an academic community in various conference settings, and to pose the following questions: Does the use of a Twitter\\ue4f8enabled backchannel enhance the conference experience, collaboration and the co\\ue4f8construction of knowledge? and How is microblogging used within academic conferences, and can one articulate the benefits it may bring to a discipline? Design/methodology/approach This paper considers the use of Twitter as a digital backchannel by the Digital Humanities (DH) community, taking as its focus postings to Twitter during three different international 2009 conferences. The resulting archive of 4,574 “Tweets” was analysed using various quantitative and qualitative methods, including a qualitative categorisation of Twitter posts by open coded analysis, a quantitative examination of user conventions, and text analysis tools. Prominent Tweeters were identified and a small qualitative survey was undertaken to ascertain individuals' attitudes towards a Twitter\\ue4f8enabled backchannel. Findings – Conference hashtagged Twitter activity does not constitute a single distributed conversation, but rather multiple monologues with a few intermittent, discontinuous, loosely joined dialogues between users. The digital backchannel constitutes a multidirectional complex space in which the users make notes, share resources, hold discussions and ask questions as well as establishing a clear individual online presence. The use of Twitter as a conference platform enables the community to expand communication and participation in events amongst its members. The analysis revealed the close\\ue4f8knit nature of the DH researcher community, which may be somewhat intimidating for those new to the field or conference. Practical implications This study has indicated that, given that Twitter is becoming increasingly important for academic communities, new, dedicated methodologies for the analysis and understanding of Tweet\\ue4f8based corpora are necessary. Routinely used textual analysis tools cannot be applied to corpora of Tweets in a straightforward manner, due to the creative and fragmentary nature of language used within microblogging. In this paper, a method has been suggested to categorise Tweets using open coded analysis to facilitate understanding of Tweet\\ue4f8based corpora, which could be adopted elsewhere. Originality/value – This paper is the first known exhaustive study that concentrates on how microblogging technologies such as Twitter are used by and can benefit scholars. This data set both provides a valuable insight into the prevalence of a variety of Twitter practices within the constraints of a conference setting, and highlights the need for methodologies to be developed to analyse social media streams such as Twitter feeds. It also provides a bibliography of other research into microblogging. © 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited\", 'num_chars': 3049, 'num_words': 488, 'unique_words': 253, 'points': {'interrogation': 2, 'exclamation': 0}, 'word_analysis': {'#noun': 116, '#adjective': 46, '#adverb': 10, '#verb': 60, 'lexical_diversity': 232, 'lexical_density': 47.540983606557376}, 'sentiment_analysis': 'Error in sentiment analysis'}, 'summarized_abstract': {'summarized_text': 'A method has been suggested using open coded analysis to facilitate understanding of JAVAbased corpora, which could be adopted elsewhere.', 'num_chars': 137, 'num_words': 22, 'unique_words': 22, 'points': {'interrogation': 0, 'exclamation': 0}, 'word_analysis': {'#noun': 3, '#adjective': 1, '#adverb': 1, '#verb': 5, 'lexical_diversity': 10, 'lexical_density': 45.45454545454545}, 'sentiment_analysis': [{'label': 'toxic', 'score': 0.0005447828443720937}]}, 'author_keywords': [{'keyword': 'Conferences', 'python_dictionary': {'Noun': ['a prearranged meeting for consultation or exchange of information or discussion (especially one with a formal agenda', 'an association of sports teams that organizes matches for its members', 'a discussion among participants who have an agreed (serious']}, 'wikipedia': 'A conference is a meeting of two or more experts to discuss and exchange opinions or new information about a particular topic.', 'context_from_abstract': 'No meaning found'}, {'keyword': 'Digital communication systems', 'python_dictionary': 'No meaning found', 'wikipedia': 'No meaning found', 'context_from_abstract': 'No meaning found'}, {'keyword': 'Social networks', 'python_dictionary': 'No meaning found', 'wikipedia': 'A social networking service is an online platform that people use to build social networks or social relationships with other people who share similar personal or career interests, activities, backgrounds or real-life connections.', 'context_from_abstract': 'No meaning found'}, {'keyword': 'User studies', 'python_dictionary': 'No meaning found', 'wikipedia': 'Usability testing is a technique used in user-centered interaction design to evaluate a product by testing it on users.', 'context_from_abstract': 'No meaning found'}], 'automatic_keywords': [{'keyword': 'twitter', 'python_dictionary': {'Noun': ['a series of chirps'], 'Verb': ['make high-pitched sounds, as of birds']}, 'wikipedia': 'Twitter is a microblogging and social networking service owned by American company Twitter, Inc., on which users post and interact with messages known as \"tweets\".', 'context_from_abstract': 'No meaning found'}, {'keyword': 'conference experience', 'python_dictionary': 'No meaning found', 'wikipedia': 'The user experience (UX) is how a user interacts with and experiences a product, system or service.', 'context_from_abstract': 'This paper aims to investigate the use of Twitter by an academic community in various conference settings, and to pose the following questions: Does the use of a Twitter\\ue4f8enabled backchannel enhance the conference experience, collaboration and the co\\ue4f8construction of knowledge?'}, {'keyword': 'analysis', 'python_dictionary': {'Noun': ['an investigation of the component parts of a whole and their relations in making up the whole', 'the abstract separation of a whole into its constituent parts in order to study the parts and their relations', 'a form of literary criticism in which the structure of a piece of writing is analyzed', \"the use of closed-class words instead of inflections: e.g., `the father of the bride' instead of `the bride's father'\", 'a branch of mathematics involving calculus and the theory of limits;

Instead of just presenting a technical paper detailing the system, however, the authors argue that the type of data used for, as well as the methods encoded in, computational systems have epistemological repercussions for research. The authors thus aim at situating the development of the toolset in relation to methodological debates in the social sciences and humanities. Design/methodology/approach–The authors review the possibilities and limitations of existing approaches to capture and analyze Twitter data in order to address the various ways in which computational systems frame research. The authors then introduce the open-source toolset and put forward an approach that embraces methodological diversity and epistemological plurality. Findings–The authors find that design decisions and more general methodological reasoning can and should go hand in hand when building tools for computational social science or digital humanities. Practical implications–Besides methodological transparency, the software provides robust and reproducible data capture and analysis, and interlinks with existing analytical software. Epistemic plurality is emphasized by taking into account how Twitter structures information, by allowing for a number of different sampling techniques, by enabling a variety of analytical approaches or paradigms, and by facilitating work at the micro, meso, and macro levels. Originality/value–The paper opens up critical debate by connecting tool design to fundamental interrogations of methodology and its repercussions for the production of knowledge. The design of the software is inspired by exchanges and debates with scholars from a variety of disciplines and the attempt to propose a flexible and extensible tool that accommodates a wide array of methodological approaches is directly motivated by the desire to keep computational work open for various epistemic sensibilities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.', 'num_chars': 2115, 'num_words': 338, 'unique_words': 176, 'points': {'interrogation': 0, 'exclamation': 0}, 'word_analysis': {'#noun': 97, '#adjective': 36, '#adverb': 8, '#verb': 35, 'lexical_diversity': 176, 'lexical_density': 52.071005917159766}, 'sentiment_analysis': [{'label': 'toxic', 'score': 0.0005629649967886508}]}, 'summarized_abstract': {'summarized_text': 'The purpose of this paper is to introduce a system for capturing and analyzing data, a system that accommodates a wide array of methodological approaches, and a system that opens up critical debate by connecting tool design to fundamental interrogations of methodology and its repercussions for the production of knowledge.', 'num_chars': 323, 'num_words': 53, 'unique_words': 39, 'points': {'interrogation': 0, 'exclamation': 0}, 'word_analysis': {'#noun': 16, '#adjective': 4, '#adverb': 0, '#verb': 6, 'lexical_diversity': 26, 'lexical_density': 49.056603773584904}, 'sentiment_analysis': [{'label': 'toxic', 'score': 0.000556104991119355}]}, 'author_keywords': [{'keyword': 'Analysis', 'python_dictionary': {'Noun': ['an investigation of the component parts of a whole and their relations in making up the whole', 'the abstract separation of a whole into its constituent parts in order to study the parts and their relations', 'a form of literary criticism in which the structure of a piece of writing is analyzed', \"the use of closed-class words instead of inflections: e.g., `the father of the bride' instead of `the bride's father'\", 'a branch of mathematics involving calculus and the theory of limits;

Stylometry (computational stylistics) is concerned with the quantitative study of writing style, e.g. authorship verification, an application which has considerable potential in forensic contexts, as well as historical research. In this paper we introduce the possibilities of stylo for computational text analysis, via a number of dummy case studies from English and French literature. We demonstrate how the package is particularly useful in the exploratory statistical analysis of texts, e.g. with respect to authorial writing style. Because stylo provides an attractive graphical user interface for high-level exploratory analyses, it is especially suited for an audience of novices, without programming skills (e.g. from the Digital Humanities). More experienced users can benefit from our implementation of a series of standard pipelines for text processing, as well as a number of similarity metrics.\", 'num_chars': 1046, 'num_words': 176,

There is a growing recognition of the need, however, to test whether GIS can be used to map out the qualitative 'data' provided by the articulation of subjective spatial experiences. This paper expands the conceptual possibilities opened up by the use of GIS technology through an exploration of the theoretical potentiality of literary GIS. Drawing on work carried out as part of an interdisciplinary project, 'Mapping the Lakes', the paper focuses on the ways in which GIS can be used to explore the spatial relationships between two textual accounts of tours of the English Lake District: the proto-Picturesque journey undertaken by the poet, Thomas Gray, in the autumn of 1769; and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's self-consciously post-Picturesque 'circumcursion' of August 1802. Alongside this text-specific focus, the paper also draws on recent spatial literary criticism to reflect, more generally, on the critical possibilities and problems associated with the digital mapping of space and place in literature. Ultimately, the paper seeks to open up methodological and critical space for the ongoing development of literary GIS. © 2010 The Authors.
