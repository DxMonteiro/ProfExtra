In particular, it critically explores new forms of empiricism that declare \u2018the end of theory\u2019, the creation of data-driven rather than knowledge-driven science, and the development of digital humanities and computational social sciences that propose radically different ways to make sense of culture, history, economy and society. It is argued that: (1) Big Data and new data analytics are disruptive innovations which are reconfiguring in many instances how research is conducted; and (2) there is an urgent need for wider critical reflection within the academy on the epistemological implications of the unfolding data revolution, a task that has barely begun to be tackled despite the rapid changes in research practices presently taking place. After critically reviewing emerging epistemological positions, it is contended that a potentially fruitful approach would be the development of a situated, reflexive and contextually nuanced epistemology. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.", "num_chars": 1318, "num_words": 216, "unique_words": 135, "points": {"interrogation": 0, "exclamation": 0}, "word_analysis": {"#noun": 53, "#adjective": 20, "#adverb": 8, "#verb": 24, "lexical_diversity": 105, "lexical_density": 48.61111111111111}, "sentiment_analysis": [{"label": "toxic", "score": 0.0006265664706006646}]}, "summarized_abstract": {"summarized_text": "This article examines how the availability of Microsoft, coupled with new data analytics, challenges established epistemologies across the sciences, social sciences and arts, and assesses the extent to which they are engendering paradigm shifts across multiple disciplines.", "num_chars": 273, "num_words": 42, "unique_words": 34, "points": {"interrogation": 0, "exclamation": 0}, "word_analysis": {"#noun": 13, "#adjective": 3, "#adverb": 0, "#verb": 5, "lexical_diversity": 21, "lexical_density": 50.0}, "sentiment_analysis": [{"label": "toxic", "score": 0.0005409102886915207}]}, "author_keywords": [{"keyword": "Big Data", "python_dictionary": "No meaning found", "wikipedia": "Big data refers to data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software.", "context_from_abstract": "This article examines how the availability of Big Data, coupled with new data analytics, challenges established epistemologies across the sciences, social sciences and humanities, and assesses the extent to which they are engendering paradigm shifts across multiple disciplines."}, {"keyword": "computational social sciences", "python_dictionary": "No meaning found", "wikipedia": "Computational social science is the academic sub-discipline concerned with computational approaches to the social sciences.", "context_from_abstract": "In particular, it critically explores new forms of empiricism that declare \u2018the end of theory\u2019, the creation of data-driven rather than knowledge-driven science, and the development of digital humanities and computational social sciences that propose radically different ways to make sense of culture, history, economy and society."}, {"keyword": "data analytics", "python_dictionary": "No meaning found", "wikipedia": "Data analysis  is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.", "context_from_abstract": "This article examines how the availability of Big Data, coupled with new data analytics, challenges established epistemologies across the sciences, social sciences and humanities, and assesses the extent to which they are engendering paradigm shifts across multiple disciplines."}, {"keyword": "data-driven science", "python_dictionary": "No meaning found", "wikipedia": "Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data, and apply knowledge from data across a broad range of application domains.", "context_from_abstract": "No meaning found"}, {"keyword": "digital humanities", "python_dictionary": "No meaning found", "wikipedia": "Digital humanities (DH) is an area of scholarly activity at the intersection of computing or digital technologies and the disciplines of the humanities.", "context_from_abstract": "In particular, it critically explores new forms of empiricism that declare \u2018the end of theory\u2019, the creation of data-driven rather than knowledge-driven science, and the development of digital humanities and computational social sciences that propose radically different ways to make sense of culture, history, economy and society."}, {"keyword": "end of theory", "python_dictionary": "No meaning found", "wikipedia": "The Low End Theory is the second studio album by American hip-hop group A Tribe Called Quest, released on September 24, 1991, by Jive Records.", "context_from_abstract": "In particular, it critically explores new forms of empiricism that declare \u2018the end of theory\u2019, the creation of data-driven rather than knowledge-driven science, and the development of digital humanities and computational social sciences that propose radically different ways to make sense of culture, history, economy and society."}, {"keyword": "epistemology", "python_dictionary": {"Noun": ["the philosophical theory of knowledge"]}, "wikipedia": "Epistemology ( (listen);

This paper aims to investigate the use of Twitter by an academic community in various conference settings, and to pose the following questions: Does the use of a Twitter\ue4f8enabled backchannel enhance the conference experience, collaboration and the co\ue4f8construction of knowledge? and How is microblogging used within academic conferences, and can one articulate the benefits it may bring to a discipline? Design/methodology/approach This paper considers the use of Twitter as a digital backchannel by the Digital Humanities (DH) community, taking as its focus postings to Twitter during three different international 2009 conferences. The resulting archive of 4,574 \u201cTweets\u201d was analysed using various quantitative and qualitative methods, including a qualitative categorisation of Twitter posts by open coded analysis, a quantitative examination of user conventions, and text analysis tools. Prominent Tweeters were identified and a small qualitative survey was undertaken to ascertain individuals' attitudes towards a Twitter\ue4f8enabled backchannel. Findings \u2013 Conference hashtagged Twitter activity does not constitute a single distributed conversation, but rather multiple monologues with a few intermittent, discontinuous, loosely joined dialogues between users. The digital backchannel constitutes a multidirectional complex space in which the users make notes, share resources, hold discussions and ask questions as well as establishing a clear individual online presence. The use of Twitter as a conference platform enables the community to expand communication and participation in events amongst its members. The analysis revealed the close\ue4f8knit nature of the DH researcher community, which may be somewhat intimidating for those new to the field or conference. Practical implications This study has indicated that, given that Twitter is becoming increasingly important for academic communities, new, dedicated methodologies for the analysis and understanding of Tweet\ue4f8based corpora are necessary. Routinely used textual analysis tools cannot be applied to corpora of Tweets in a straightforward manner, due to the creative and fragmentary nature of language used within microblogging. In this paper, a method has been suggested to categorise Tweets using open coded analysis to facilitate understanding of Tweet\ue4f8based corpora, which could be adopted elsewhere. Originality/value \u2013 This paper is the first known exhaustive study that concentrates on how microblogging technologies such as Twitter are used by and can benefit scholars. This data set both provides a valuable insight into the prevalence of a variety of Twitter practices within the constraints of a conference setting, and highlights the need for methodologies to be developed to analyse social media streams such as Twitter feeds. It also provides a bibliography of other research into microblogging. \u00a9 2011, Emerald Group Publishing Limited", "num_chars": 3049, "num_words": 488, "unique_words": 253, "points": {"interrogation": 2, "exclamation": 0}, "word_analysis": {"#noun": 116, "#adjective": 46, "#adverb": 10, "#verb": 60, "lexical_diversity": 232, "lexical_density": 47.540983606557376}, "sentiment_analysis": "Error in sentiment analysis"}, "summarized_abstract": {"summarized_text": "A method has been suggested using open coded analysis to facilitate understanding of JAVAbased corpora, which could be adopted elsewhere.", "num_chars": 137, "num_words": 22, "unique_words": 22, "points": {"interrogation": 0, "exclamation": 0}, "word_analysis": {"#noun": 3, "#adjective": 1, "#adverb": 1, "#verb": 5, "lexical_diversity": 10, "lexical_density": 45.45454545454545}, "sentiment_analysis": [{"label": "toxic", "score": 0.0005447828443720937}]}, "author_keywords": [{"keyword": "Conferences", "python_dictionary": {"Noun": ["a prearranged meeting for consultation or exchange of information or discussion (especially one with a formal agenda", "an association of sports teams that organizes matches for its members", "a discussion among participants who have an agreed (serious"]}, "wikipedia": "A conference is a meeting of two or more experts to discuss and exchange opinions or new information about a particular topic.", "context_from_abstract": "No meaning found"}, {"keyword": "Digital communication systems", "python_dictionary": "No meaning found", "wikipedia": "No meaning found", "context_from_abstract": "No meaning found"}, {"keyword": "Social networks", "python_dictionary": "No meaning found", "wikipedia": "A social networking service is an online platform that people use to build social networks or social relationships with other people who share similar personal or career interests, activities, backgrounds or real-life connections.", "context_from_abstract": "No meaning found"}, {"keyword": "User studies", "python_dictionary": "No meaning found", "wikipedia": "Usability testing is a technique used in user-centered interaction design to evaluate a product by testing it on users.", "context_from_abstract": "No meaning found"}], "automatic_keywords": [{"keyword": "twitter", "python_dictionary": {"Noun": ["a series of chirps"], "Verb": ["make high-pitched sounds, as of birds"]}, "wikipedia": "Twitter is a microblogging and social networking service owned by American company Twitter, Inc., on which users post and interact with messages known as \"tweets\".", "context_from_abstract": "No meaning found"}, {"keyword": "conference experience", "python_dictionary": "No meaning found", "wikipedia": "The user experience (UX) is how a user interacts with and experiences a product, system or service.", "context_from_abstract": "This paper aims to investigate the use of Twitter by an academic community in various conference settings, and to pose the following questions: Does the use of a Twitter\ue4f8enabled backchannel enhance the conference experience, collaboration and the co\ue4f8construction of knowledge?"}, {"keyword": "analysis", "python_dictionary": {"Noun": ["an investigation of the component parts of a whole and their relations in making up the whole", "the abstract separation of a whole into its constituent parts in order to study the parts and their relations", "a form of literary criticism in which the structure of a piece of writing is analyzed", "the use of closed-class words instead of inflections: e.g., `the father of the bride' instead of `the bride's father'", "a branch of mathematics involving calculus and the theory of limits;

This paper expands the conceptual possibilities opened up by the use of GIS technology through an exploration of the theoretical potentiality of literary GIS. Drawing on work carried out as part of an interdisciplinary project, 'Mapping the Lakes', the paper focuses on the ways in which GIS can be used to explore the spatial relationships between two textual accounts of tours of the English Lake District: the proto-Picturesque journey undertaken by the poet, Thomas Gray, in the autumn of 1769; and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's self-consciously post-Picturesque 'circumcursion' of August 1802. Alongside this text-specific focus, the paper also draws on recent spatial literary criticism to reflect, more generally, on the critical possibilities and problems associated with the digital mapping of space and place in literature. Ultimately, the paper seeks to open up methodological and critical space for the ongoing development of literary GIS. \u00a9 2010 The Authors.
