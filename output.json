METHODS We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial in the United Kingdom that enrolled adult patients with symptomatic chronic subdural hematoma. The patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a 2-week tapering course of oral dexamethasone, starting at 8 mg twice daily, or placebo. The decision to surgically evacuate the hematoma was made by the treating clinician. The primary outcome was a score of 0 to 3, representing a favorable outcome, on the modified Rankin scale at 6 months after randomization; scores range from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death).

The mean age of the patients was 74 years, and 94% underwent surgery to evacuate their hematomas during the index admission; 60% in both groups had a score of 1 to 3 on the modified Rankin scale at admission. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis that excluded the patients who withdrew con- sent for participation in the trial or who were lost to follow-up, leaving a total of 680 patients, a favorable outcome was reported in 286 of 341 patients (83.9%) in the dexamethasone group and in 306 of 339 patients (90.3%) in the placebo group (difference, \u22126.4 percentage points [95% confidence interval, \u221211.4 to \u22121.4] in favor of the placebo group; P = 0.01). Among the patients with available data, repeat surgery for recurrence of the hematoma was performed in 6 of 349 patients (1.7%) in the dexamethasone group and in 25 of 350 patients (7.1%) in the placebo group. More adverse events occurred in the dexamethasone group than in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS Among adults with symptomatic chronic subdural hematoma, most of whom had undergone surgery to remove their hematomas during the index admission, treat- ment with dexamethasone resulted in fewer favorable outcomes and more adverse events than placebo at 6 months, but fewer repeat operations were performed in the dexamethasone group.

      "Chronic subdural hematoma is a common neurologic disorder that affects mainly older people.1 The disorder is char- acterized by a collection of blood and blood- breakdown products in the intracranial subdural space that liquefies over time. The inciting event is often minor head trauma, and subsequent inflammation may play a role in the pathogene- sis.2 The time of onset of chronic subdural hema- toma is often not known. The incidence of chronic subdural hematoma is increasing owing to an aging population and the use of antico- agulant and antiplatelet medications.3 Chronic subdural hematoma evacuation has been pro- jected to become the most common cranial neurosurgical operation among adults by the year 2030 in the United States.4 Patients with chronic subdural hematoma often present with cognitive impairment, gait disturbance, limb weakness, or headache, and the diagnosis is made on the basis of cranial imaging.5 Surgical evacuation of the subdural col- lection remains the main treatment approach for symptomatic patients; however, the hematoma re- curs in 10 to 20% of surgically treated patients.1,6 Glucocorticoids have been used to treat chronic subdural hematoma.7 Systematic reviews have concluded that glucocorticoids may be safe and effective when used in addition to surgery, with the aim of reducing the risk of recurrence, or as stand-alone therapy, with the aim of avoid- ing surgery.8,9 However, there is limited evidence from multicenter, randomized trials to assess the effects of glucocorticoids on outcomes. We conducted a multicenter, randomized, placebo- controlled trial to assess the effect of dexameth- asone on outcomes in patients with symptom- atic chronic subdural hematoma.",
      "The Dexamethasone for Adult Patients with a Symptomatic Chronic Subdural Haematoma (Dex-CSDH) trial was a multicenter, randomized trial that was conducted in the United Kingdom. The trial compared a tapering 2-week course of dexamethasone with matching placebo in pa- tients with symptomatic chronic subdural hema- toma.10 Ethical approval in the United Kingdom was obtained from the North-West Haydock Research and Ethics Committee in 2015. An in- ternal pilot randomized trial, which enrolled 100 patients at seven trial sites, confirmed the operational feasibility of the overall trial.11 As pre- specified, the pilot phase did not aim to assess efficacy or reestimate the sample size, and these patients were included in the final analysis. When possible, written informed consent was obtained from the patients or from their legal representative if they lacked the capacity to pro- vide consent. If a patient was unable to provide consent and lacked a legal representative, agree- ment by an independent health care professional was necessary for enrollment. An independent trial steering committee and an independent data monitoring and ethics committee reviewed the trial every 6 to 12 months to assess conduct, progress, and safety. The trial protocol was designed by neurosur- geons, neurologists, stroke physicians, and geria- tricians from several hospitals and universities in the United Kingdom, with methodologic input from members of the Cambridge Clinical Trials Unit. Details of the protocol have been pub- lished previously10 and are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The investigators vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and analyses, for the complete reporting of adverse events, and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol and statistical analysis plan (avail- able with the protocol). The analysis was con- ducted by two authors from the Cambridge Clinical Trials Unit who are statisticians. The first draft of the manuscript was written by the first two authors and the last author and was revised by all the authors, who collectively agreed to submit the manuscript for publication.",
      "Patients were eligible for enrollment if they were 18 years or age and older and were admitted to a participating neurosurgical unit with symp- tomatic chronic subdural hematoma that had been confirmed on cranial imaging. Trial sites were hospitals in the United Kingdom that pro- vide emergency neurosurgical services 24 hours per day (Section S1 in the Supplementary Ap- pendix, available at NEJM.org). A chronic sub- dural hematoma was defined pragmatically as a predominantly hypodense or isodense (relative to the brain) crescentic collection along the ce- rebral convexity on computed tomography (CT) of the head. Symptoms that were attributable to a chronic subdural hematoma and met trial in- clusion criteria included headache, gait disturbance, confusion or cognitive decline, limb weak- ness, speech disturbance, drowsiness or decreased consciousness, and seizures. Patients with mild or severe symptoms were enrolled; none of the enrolled patients were asymptomatic. Patients were excluded if they had conditions for which glucocorticoids are contraindicated (e.g., active systemic infection, recent peptic ul- ceration or gastrointestinal bleeding), were re- ceiving (or had been receiving within 1 month before screening) oral or intravenous glucocorti- coids on a regular basis, were previously en- rolled in this trial for a separate chronic subdu- ral hematoma episode, had a cerebrospinal fluid shunt, had severe lactose intolerance or a known hypersensitivity to dexamethasone or other ex- cipient, had a history of psychotic disorders, or were unwilling to take products containing gela- tin. Patients were not eligible for randomization if they were not able to receive the first dose of the trial drug or placebo within 72 hours after admission to the neurosurgical unit. Patients with an acute hematoma, as indicated by a pre- dominantly hyperdense (relative to the brain) subdural collection on a CT scan, were not eli- gible for randomization.",
      "Patients were treated in neurosurgical units ac- cording to standard practice. In the United Kingdom, standard practice typically includes burr hole evacuation of the hematoma with the use of a subdural drain.5 The decision to per- form surgical evacuation of the subdural collec- tion or conservative monitoring was made by the clinical team in conjunction with the patient. Enrollment took place irrespective of the deci- sion to operate and the timing of the surgical intervention. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a tapering 2-week course of oral dexamethasone (8 mg twice daily on days 1 to 3, then 6 mg twice daily on days 4 to 6, then 4 mg twice daily on days 7 to 9, then 2 mg twice daily on days 10 to 12, and then 2 mg once daily on days 13 and 14) or matching placebo. If oral administration was not possible, the trial agent was administered in a nasogastric tube. Patients could complete the tapering course at home if they were discharged. Adherence was assessed by reviewing medication records and patient diaries if the medication was taken at home. Randomization was performed with the use of permuted blocks (random block sizes of two or four), with stratification according to trial site. An interactive Web-based response system was used for allocating treatment packs of 62 dexamethasone tablets (2 mg) or 62 pla- cebo capsules, both overencapsulated to look identical. The assigned trial drug or placebo was administered as part of the routine drug round by unit nurses.",
      "In keeping with previous studies of chronic sub- dural hematomas,5,12 the primary outcome was a score of 0 to 3 on the modified Rankin scale at 6 months after randomization. The modified Rankin scale is an ordinal outcome scale of dis- ability or dependence with respect to activities of daily living and was originally designed for use in patients with stroke but is used in patients with other disorders, including chronic subdural hematoma.13,14 The scale has seven categories: no symptoms (0), no clinically significant dis- ability despite symptoms (1), slight disability (2), moderate disability (3), moderately severe dis- ability (4), severe disability (5), and death (6); in this trial, a score of 0 to 3 was used to represent a favorable outcome. Our hypothesis was that dexamethasone would improve the 6-month functional outcome in pa- tients with symptomatic chronic subdural hema- toma by reducing the need for surgical interven- tions and recurrence of the hematoma after surgery. The scores on the modified Rankin scale were assessed with the use of a validated simplified questionnaire, which was completed by the patients or caregivers at 3 months and 6 months after randomization; if no response was received, a trial team member contacted the patient or caregiver by telephone to complete the questionnaire.15 All completed questionnaires were reviewed at the coordinating center by a clinically trained investigator, who was unaware of the trial-group assignments; this investigator calculated the modified Rankin scale score ac- cording to a standardized algorithm (Section S3). Secondary outcomes were the score on the modified Rankin scale at discharge from the neurosurgical unit and at 3 months after ran- domization; mortality at 30 days and 6 months after randomization; the number of patients who underwent surgical interventions related to chronic subdural hematoma during the index admission; the number of patients who under- went surgical interventions related to chronic subdural hematoma during subsequent admis- sions in the follow-up period; the score on the Glasgow Coma Scale (scores range from 3 to 15, with higher scores indicating better neurologic status) at discharge and at 6 months; the score on the Barthel Index at discharge and at 3 months and 6 months after randomization (scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a greater ability to complete activities of daily living)16 ; EuroQol Group 5-Dimension 5-Level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) utility index score at discharge and at 3 months and 6 months after randomization (responses on the EQ-5D-5L were converted into a utility index score with the use of the cross-walk algorithm; scores range from \u22120.594 [health state worse than death] to 1 [per- fect health state] \u2014 patients who died were given a score of zero)17,18 ; length of stay in the neurosurgical unit; discharge destination from the neurosurgical unit; length of stay in second- ary care; and adverse events. Postoperative recur- rence of subdural hematoma was a tertiary out- come that was defined as a symptomatic recurrence leading to reoperation of a previously evacuated ipsilateral chronic subdural hematoma.19 Ad- verse events of special interest included hyper- glycemia leading to treatment or discontinuation of the trial regimen, new-onset diabetes, hyperos- molar hyperglycemic state, new-onset psychosis, peptic ulceration or gastrointestinal bleeding, and other upper gastrointestinal side effects."
